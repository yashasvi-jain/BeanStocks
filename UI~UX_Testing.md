We have come to the consensus that we will not be conducting UI/UX Testing for our application. The reason is that we want to focus on creation of the neural network as it is the heart of the project. The neural network supports our prediction and analysis algorithm and without it our product would not be functional. To take the MVP to its next stage we need to get through with the basics. A UI/UX Testing at this stage would disturb the timeline we have decided on for our project.
