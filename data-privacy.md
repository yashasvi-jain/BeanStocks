In particular, we do not re-distribute or sell personal information collected on our web servers.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED**

Our web servers collect the following information: user's credentials, user's stock portfolio, tweets from [Twitter](twitter.com) and historical stock data from yahoo finance. 

Information is also collected and stored when users log in to view restricted content or submit forms. This done using JWT (json-web-tokens) mapped to an account created on the server.

**USE OF WEB FORMS**

We primarily use web forms to collect the credential of the user when signing-up or loging-in a user. The credentials are then authenticated against the data on our servers via a HTTP request. A logged-in user can submit his stock portfolio using web forms. This information is collected and stored in the same manner.

**USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION**

We will use the credentials to authenticate the users. The information about their stock portfolio will be used by algorithms to provide predictions. The user may choose to opt out of the use of his financial information.
